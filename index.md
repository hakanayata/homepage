# Hello!

I'm Brian, a Software Engineer at [Automattic](https://automattic.com).
I graduated from Harvard College in 2019 with a degree in computer science and linguistics
and from Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2021 with a master's degree in technology, innovation, and education.

Before joining Automattic, I worked at Harvard as a Senior Preceptor in computer science,
where I created courses focusing on [artificial intelligence](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)
and [web programming](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript),
and where I was a course head for [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), Harvard's introductory course in computer science.
I've also worked previously at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com) and the [National Speech and Debate Association](https://www.speechanddebate.org).
